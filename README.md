### Project goals:<br />
* Create interesting, real-time animations by writing simple, low-level code.
* Explore math, procedural generation techniques and audio programming.
* Eventually, create a demoscene production and submit it to a demo party.

### Project info:<br />
* Code is fully standalone, it compiles by running <b>make.bat</b> on any Windows 10 machine (no Visual Studio or any other software is needed).
* No external headers or libs are required (not even system or libc headers).
* Only external functions used are LoadLibrary and GetProcAddress. Everything else is loaded at runtime.
